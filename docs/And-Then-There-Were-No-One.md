 And Then There Were No One 《无人生还》是阿加莎·克里斯蒂1939年创作的小说，并由她亲自操刀改编成话剧，也是阿加莎本人最满意的话剧作品。小说最初于1939年以Ten Little Niggers的书名出版，后曾改为Ten Little Indians。1943年小说由作者本人改编成话剧上演，后来这个故事被多次改编成影视作品，而作品的累计销量已超过一亿册。

这部小说被阿加莎·克里斯蒂本人和广大侦探迷们誉为其最优秀的作品之一，在侦探小说的发展史上占据着重要的地位。克里斯蒂在自传中提到这本书“线索既清晰明快又令人迷惑不解，可解释又合情合理”，并且她自己“比评论家更清楚写这本书是多么不易”。作为英美侦探小说的代表作品，《无人生还》不仅在情节构思和叙述技巧上有其独到之处，更反映了对人性和道德的思考。
