**在什么重要问题上你与其他人有不同看法？**


1. Of course, it’s easier to copy a model than to make something new. Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1.

1. No one can predict the future exactly, but we know two things: it’s going to be different, and it must be rooted in today’s world.

**我们应该如何定义进步的未来？**

1. My own answer to the contrarian question is that most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more.

1. Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can.

1. A new company’s most important strength is new thinking: even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think.

**人们倾向于在什么问题上观点一致？**
**20世纪90年代的互联网热潮到底带来了什么？**

1. If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth.

1. But it’s hard to blame people for dancing when the music was playing; irrationality was rational given that appending “.com” to your name could double your value overnight.

**PayPal如何在互联网泡沫破裂的局面下幸存的？**
**我们从互联网泡沫破裂的历史中得到了什么教训？**

1. The market high of March 2000 was obviously a peak of insanity; less obvious but more important, it was also a peak of clarity.

2. The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

1. The entrepreneurs who stuck with Silicon Valley learned four big lesson from the dot-com crash that still guide business thinking today:

- Make incremental advances.
- Stayl lean and flexible.
- Improve on the competition.
- Focus on product,not sales.

**什么公司才是既前无古人又具有高价值的呢？**
**竞争和垄断，哪一个才能让公司真正立于不败之地？**

1. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.

**垄断对企业本身的益处明显，那垄断给市场和消费者带来了什么呢？**
**既然垄断本身好处多多，那为什么这么多经济学家要痴迷于市场的“竞争”呢？**

1. The competitive ecosystem pushes people toward ruthlessness or death.
2. Creative monopolies aren’t just good for the rest of society; they’re powerful engines for making it better.
3. All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.

google's core value:
1. Focus on the user and all else will follow.（以用户为中心，其他一切自然水到渠成。）
2. It’s best to do one thing really, really well.（专心将一件事做到极致。）
3. Fast is better than slow.（越快越好。）
4. Democracy on the web works.（网络也应当民主。）
5. You don’t need to be at your desk to need an answer.（信息随处可得。）
6. You can make money without doing evil.（赚钱不必作恶。）
7. There’s always more information out there.（信息无极限。）
8. The need for information crosses all borders.（信息需求无国界。）
9. You can be serious without a suit.（认真不在着装。）
10. Great just isn’t good enough.（追求无止境。）

**为什么人们相信竞争才是健康的状态？**
**为什么人们喜欢一较高下呢？**
**竞争会带来什么样的问题？**

1. Creative monopoly means new products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator.
2. Amid all the human drama, people lose sight of what matters and focus on their rivals instead.

**相似企业之间的竞争，造成了哪些恶果？**

1. War is costly business.
2. Winning is better than losing, but everybody loses when the war isn’t one worth fighting.
3. If you can recognize competition as a destructive force instead of a sign of value, you’re already saner than most.

**怎样才能更加理性地建立一个垄断性的企业？**
1. Escaping competition will give you a monopoly, but even a monopoly is only a great business if it can endure in the future.
2. To properly value a business, you also have to discount those future cash flows to their present worth, since a given amount of money today is worth more than the same amount in the future.

**垄断企业有哪些共同特征？**
**如何让自己的公司更有前景，更加长寿？**

1. Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.
2. Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate.

垄断企业通常会有以下几个特点：
1.  专利技术——一家公司最为实质性的优势，使其产品很难被复制，如PayPal，亚马逊，iPad。
2.  网络效益——一项产品可以随着使用人数的增多，而变得更加有用，如Facebook。
3.  规模经济——垄断企业越大则越强，因为其巨大的销量可以分摊开发成本，如Twitter。
4.  品牌优势——打造一个强势品牌是形成垄断的有力方式，如苹果，雅虎。
