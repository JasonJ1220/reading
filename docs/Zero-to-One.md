**在什么重要问题上你与其他人有不同看法？**


1. Of course, it’s easier to copy a model than to make something new. Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1.

1. No one can predict the future exactly, but we know two things: it’s going to be different, and it must be rooted in today’s world.

**我们应该如何定义进步的未来？**

1. My own answer to the contrarian question is that most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more.

1. Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can.

1. A new company’s most important strength is new thinking: even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think.

**人们倾向于在什么问题上观点一致？**
**20世纪90年代的互联网热潮到底带来了什么？**

1. If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth.

1. But it’s hard to blame people for dancing when the music was playing; irrationality was rational given that appending “.com” to your name could double your value overnight.

**PayPal如何在互联网泡沫破裂的局面下幸存的？**
**我们从互联网泡沫破裂的历史中得到了什么教训？**

1. The market high of March 2000 was obviously a peak of insanity; less obvious but more important, it was also a peak of clarity.

2. The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

1. The entrepreneurs who stuck with Silicon Valley learned four big lesson from the dot-com crash that still guide business thinking today:

- Make incremental advances.
- Stayl lean and flexible.
- Improve on the competition.
- Focus on product,not sales.

**什么公司才是既前无古人又具有高价值的呢？**
**竞争和垄断，哪一个才能让公司真正立于不败之地？**

1. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.

**垄断对企业本身的益处明显，那垄断给市场和消费者带来了什么呢？**
**既然垄断本身好处多多，那为什么这么多经济学家要痴迷于市场的“竞争”呢？**

1. The competitive ecosystem pushes people toward ruthlessness or death.
2. Creative monopolies aren’t just good for the rest of society; they’re powerful engines for making it better.
3. All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.

google's core value:
1. Focus on the user and all else will follow.（以用户为中心，其他一切自然水到渠成。）
2. It’s best to do one thing really, really well.（专心将一件事做到极致。）
3. Fast is better than slow.（越快越好。）
4. Democracy on the web works.（网络也应当民主。）
5. You don’t need to be at your desk to need an answer.（信息随处可得。）
6. You can make money without doing evil.（赚钱不必作恶。）
7. There’s always more information out there.（信息无极限。）
8. The need for information crosses all borders.（信息需求无国界。）
9. You can be serious without a suit.（认真不在着装。）
10. Great just isn’t good enough.（追求无止境。）


## 2018.12.13
**为什么人们相信竞争才是健康的状态？**
**为什么人们喜欢一较高下呢？**
**竞争会带来什么样的问题？**

1. Creative monopoly means new products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator.
2. Amid all the human drama, people lose sight of what matters and focus on their rivals instead.


## 2018.12.14
**相似企业之间的竞争，造成了哪些恶果？**

1. War is costly business.
2. Winning is better than losing, but everybody loses when the war isn’t one worth fighting.
3. If you can recognize competition as a destructive force instead of a sign of value, you’re already saner than most. 


## 2018.12.15
**怎样才能更加理性地建立一个垄断性的企业？**
1. Escaping competition will give you a monopoly, but even a monopoly is only a great business if it can endure in the future.
2. To properly value a business, you also have to discount those future cash flows to their present worth, since a given amount of money today is worth more than the same amount in the future.

**垄断企业有哪些共同特征？**
**如何让自己的公司更有前景，更加长寿？**

1. Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.
2. Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate.

垄断企业通常会有以下几个特点：
1.  专利技术——一家公司最为实质性的优势，使其产品很难被复制，如PayPal，亚马逊，iPad。
2.  网络效益——一项产品可以随着使用人数的增多，而变得更加有用，如Facebook。
3.  规模经济——垄断企业越大则越强，因为其巨大的销量可以分摊开发成本，如Twitter。
4.  品牌优势——打造一个强势品牌是形成垄断的有力方式，如苹果，雅虎。

**如何建立一个垄断企业？如何选择企业的市场，并逐步扩大规模?**
**先发者如何防止其他企业后来居上？**

1.  Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market.
2.  Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets.
3.  Indeed, if your company can be summed up by its opposition to already existing firms, it can’t be completely new and it’s probably not going to become a monopoly.

## 2018.12.18
**成功是纯属偶然，还是可以被掌握、支配的？**
1. If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you’ll give up on trying to master it.
2.  A definite view, by contrast, favors firm convictions. Instead of pursuing many-­sided mediocrity and calling it “well-roundedness,” a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it.

**假如人生靠的不只是运气，那么世界的未来是可以被计划的吗？
人们对未来的观点可以分为几种类型？
当今主宰美国社会的思想属于哪种类型？有什么具体表现？**

例证:
1.  Indefinite Pessimism——不明确的悲观主义（例：1970年后的欧洲）
2.  Definite Pessimism——明确的悲观主义（例：中国）
3.  Definite Optimism——明确的乐观主义（例：17世纪到20世纪60年代的西方世界）
4.  Indefinite Optimism——不明确的乐观主义（例：1982年后的美国）

1.  To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn't know how exactly, so he won't make any specific plans. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason to design it concretely.
2.  A whole generation learned from childhood to overrate the power of chance and underrate the importance of planning. 

**Kick the Can Down the Road**
> 这个短语本意是：小孩子在街道上踢罐子，把罐子踢远之后，另一个小孩子再捡回来，在这个踢和捡的过程中，另外的小孩可以借机藏起来。用来比喻缓兵之计。

**be dismissed as**
>被误解为

**be derided as**
>被嘲笑为

## 2018.12.20
**我们当今的世界，处于怎样的分类体系之中呢？**

1. But in an indefinite world, people actually prefer unlimited optionality; money is more valuable than anything you could possibly do with it. Only in a definite future is money a means to an end, not the end itself.
2. In philosophy, politics, and business, too, arguing over process has become a way to endlessly defer making concrete plans for a better future.
3.  We haven't yet uncovered the secrets of life, but insurers and statisticians in the 19th century successfully revealed a secret about death that still governs our thinking today: they discovered how to reduce it to a mathematical probability.

**for the most part**

## 2018.12.21
**我们不明确的乐观会带来怎样的未来？
初创企业是否需要长期的规划？**

1.  But indefinite optimism seems inherently unsustainable: how can the future get better if no one plans for it?
2.  It's true that every great entrepreneur is first and foremost a designer.
3.  A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.

## 2018.12.22
** 一般而言，成功的初创企业遵循怎样的成长曲线？
为什么风险投资的回报不会遵循正态分布？**
1. The power law—so named because exponential equations describe severely unequal distributions—is the law of the universe. It defines our surroundings so completely that we usually don't even see it.
2.  VCs must find the handful of companies that will successfully go from 0 to 1 and then back them with every resource.

论证：
1.  幂次法则（power law）是宇宙的法则，不平均的分配定义了我们周围的环境，特别是在投资领域。
2.  幂次法则（power law）描绘了排名靠前和排名靠后的个体所造成的影响力的巨大差异，这也就是幂次法则被称为power law的原因。作者认为幂次规律是宇宙的本质规律和法则，是因为这个以少胜多的模型在自然世界和人类社会中随处可见。 
2.  风险投资家（VC）的任务就是投资那些前景光明的初创企业，但大部分企业都以失败告终，因此他们的投资回报并不会呈现正态分布。
3.  风险投资基金必须发现能够实现从0到1跨越的公司，然后倾其全力支持它。（例子：Founders Fund的业绩表现；霍洛威茨投资Instragram）

## 2018.12.23
**为什么很多专业的风险投资者都忽视了幂次法则？
我们应该如何利用幂次法则？对于创业者来说，幂次法则提供了哪些启示？**
1.  But no matter how unambiguous the end result of the power law, it doesn't reflect daily experience.
2.  And since nobody wants to give up on an investment, VCs usually spend even more time on the most problematic companies than they do on the most obviously successful.
3.  As we said, even the best venture investors have a portfolio, but investors who understand the power law make as few investments as possible.
4.  The power law means that differences between companies will dwarf the differences in roles inside companies.

## 2018.12.24
**什么是商业世界反主流的问题（在哪些重要问题上你与其他人有不同的看法）？
为什么大部分人已经不相信世界还有未被探索的秘密存在？**

1.  Contrarian thinking doesn't make any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up.
2.  Every correct answer is necessarily a secret: something important and unknown, something hard to do but doable. If there are many secrets left in the world, there are probably many world-­changing companies yet to be started.
3.  Why has so much of our society come to believe that there are no hard secrets left? It might start with geography. There are no blank spaces left on the map anymore.
