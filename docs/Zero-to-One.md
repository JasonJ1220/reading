彼得·蒂尔，全名Peter Andreas Thiel，是这本从零到一（Zero to One）的作者，于1967年10月11日出生在法兰克福，拥有美国国籍，曾就读于斯坦福大学。

 

他是美国著名的企业家和风险投资人。作为PayPal的创始人之一，他曾任PayPal首席执行官，后来他又创建了Palantir，他是最早投资Facebook的投资人，同时还是对冲基金Clarium Capital的总裁。这本书的内容正是根据Thiel在斯坦福开的创业课笔记整理而成。

**在什么重要问题上你与其他人有不同看法？**


1. Of course, it’s easier to copy a model than to make something new. Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1.

1. No one can predict the future exactly, but we know two things: it’s going to be different, and it must be rooted in today’s world.

## 2018.12.8
**我们应该如何定义进步的未来？**

1. My own answer to the contrarian question is that most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more.

1. Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can.

1. A new company’s most important strength is new thinking: even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think.

## 2018.12.9
**人们倾向于在什么问题上观点一致？**
**20世纪90年代的互联网热潮到底带来了什么？**

1. If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth.

1. But it’s hard to blame people for dancing when the music was playing; irrationality was rational given that appending “.com” to your name could double your value overnight.


## 2018.12.10
**PayPal如何在互联网泡沫破裂的局面下幸存的？**
**我们从互联网泡沫破裂的历史中得到了什么教训？**

1. The market high of March 2000 was obviously a peak of insanity; less obvious but more important, it was also a peak of clarity.

2. The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

1. The entrepreneurs who stuck with Silicon Valley learned four big lesson from the dot-com crash that still guide business thinking today:

- Make incremental advances.
- Stayl lean and flexible.
- Improve on the competition.
- Focus on product,not sales.


## 2018.12.11
**什么公司才是既前无古人又具有高价值的呢？**
**竞争和垄断，哪一个才能让公司真正立于不败之地？**

1. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.


## 2018.12.12
**垄断对企业本身的益处明显，那垄断给市场和消费者带来了什么呢？**
**既然垄断本身好处多多，那为什么这么多经济学家要痴迷于市场的“竞争”呢？**

1. The competitive ecosystem pushes people toward ruthlessness or death.
2. Creative monopolies aren’t just good for the rest of society; they’re powerful engines for making it better.
3. All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.

google's core value:
1. Focus on the user and all else will follow.（以用户为中心，其他一切自然水到渠成。）
2. It’s best to do one thing really, really well.（专心将一件事做到极致。）
3. Fast is better than slow.（越快越好。）
4. Democracy on the web works.（网络也应当民主。）
5. You don’t need to be at your desk to need an answer.（信息随处可得。）
6. You can make money without doing evil.（赚钱不必作恶。）
7. There’s always more information out there.（信息无极限。）
8. The need for information crosses all borders.（信息需求无国界。）
9. You can be serious without a suit.（认真不在着装。）
10. Great just isn’t good enough.（追求无止境。）


## 2018.12.13
**为什么人们相信竞争才是健康的状态？**
**为什么人们喜欢一较高下呢？**
**竞争会带来什么样的问题？**

1. Creative monopoly means new products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator.
2. Amid all the human drama, people lose sight of what matters and focus on their rivals instead.


## 2018.12.14
**相似企业之间的竞争，造成了哪些恶果？**

1. War is costly business.
2. Winning is better than losing, but everybody loses when the war isn’t one worth fighting.
3. If you can recognize competition as a destructive force instead of a sign of value, you’re already saner than most. 


## 2018.12.15
**怎样才能更加理性地建立一个垄断性的企业？**
1. Escaping competition will give you a monopoly, but even a monopoly is only a great business if it can endure in the future.
2. To properly value a business, you also have to discount those future cash flows to their present worth, since a given amount of money today is worth more than the same amount in the future.


## 2018.12.16
**垄断企业有哪些共同特征？**
**如何让自己的公司更有前景，更加长寿？**

1. Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.
2. Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate.

垄断企业通常会有以下几个特点：
1.  专利技术——一家公司最为实质性的优势，使其产品很难被复制，如PayPal，亚马逊，iPad。
2.  网络效益——一项产品可以随着使用人数的增多，而变得更加有用，如Facebook。
3.  规模经济——垄断企业越大则越强，因为其巨大的销量可以分摊开发成本，如Twitter。
4.  品牌优势——打造一个强势品牌是形成垄断的有力方式，如苹果，雅虎。

## 2018.12.17
**如何建立一个垄断企业？如何选择企业的市场，并逐步扩大规模?**
**先发者如何防止其他企业后来居上？**

1.  Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market.
2.  Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets.
3.  Indeed, if your company can be summed up by its opposition to already existing firms, it can’t be completely new and it’s probably not going to become a monopoly.

## 2018.12.18
**成功是纯属偶然，还是可以被掌握、支配的？**
1. If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you’ll give up on trying to master it.
2.  A definite view, by contrast, favors firm convictions. Instead of pursuing many-­sided mediocrity and calling it “well-roundedness,” a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it.

## 2018.12.19
**假如人生靠的不只是运气，那么世界的未来是可以被计划的吗？
人们对未来的观点可以分为几种类型？
当今主宰美国社会的思想属于哪种类型？有什么具体表现？**

例证:
1.  Indefinite Pessimism——不明确的悲观主义（例：1970年后的欧洲）
2.  Definite Pessimism——明确的悲观主义（例：中国）
3.  Definite Optimism——明确的乐观主义（例：17世纪到20世纪60年代的西方世界）
4.  Indefinite Optimism——不明确的乐观主义（例：1982年后的美国）

1.  To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn't know how exactly, so he won't make any specific plans. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason to design it concretely.
2.  A whole generation learned from childhood to overrate the power of chance and underrate the importance of planning. 

**Kick the Can Down the Road**
> 这个短语本意是：小孩子在街道上踢罐子，把罐子踢远之后，另一个小孩子再捡回来，在这个踢和捡的过程中，另外的小孩可以借机藏起来。用来比喻缓兵之计。

**be dismissed as**
>被误解为

**be derided as**
>被嘲笑为

## 2018.12.20
**我们当今的世界，处于怎样的分类体系之中呢？**

1. But in an indefinite world, people actually prefer unlimited optionality; money is more valuable than anything you could possibly do with it. Only in a definite future is money a means to an end, not the end itself.
2. In philosophy, politics, and business, too, arguing over process has become a way to endlessly defer making concrete plans for a better future.
3.  We haven't yet uncovered the secrets of life, but insurers and statisticians in the 19th century successfully revealed a secret about death that still governs our thinking today: they discovered how to reduce it to a mathematical probability.

**for the most part**  
> 大体上来说

## 2018.12.21
**我们不明确的乐观会带来怎样的未来？
初创企业是否需要长期的规划？**

1.  But indefinite optimism seems inherently unsustainable: how can the future get better if no one plans for it?
2.  It's true that every great entrepreneur is first and foremost a designer.
3.  A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.

## 2018.12.22
** 一般而言，成功的初创企业遵循怎样的成长曲线？
为什么风险投资的回报不会遵循正态分布？**
1. The power law—so named because exponential equations describe severely unequal distributions—is the law of the universe. It defines our surroundings so completely that we usually don't even see it.
2.  VCs must find the handful of companies that will successfully go from 0 to 1 and then back them with every resource.

论证：
1.  幂次法则（power law）是宇宙的法则，不平均的分配定义了我们周围的环境，特别是在投资领域。
2.  幂次法则（power law）描绘了排名靠前和排名靠后的个体所造成的影响力的巨大差异，这也就是幂次法则被称为power law的原因。作者认为幂次规律是宇宙的本质规律和法则，是因为这个以少胜多的模型在自然世界和人类社会中随处可见。 
2.  风险投资家（VC）的任务就是投资那些前景光明的初创企业，但大部分企业都以失败告终，因此他们的投资回报并不会呈现正态分布。
3.  风险投资基金必须发现能够实现从0到1跨越的公司，然后倾其全力支持它。（例子：Founders Fund的业绩表现；霍洛威茨投资Instragram）

## 2018.12.23
**为什么很多专业的风险投资者都忽视了幂次法则？
我们应该如何利用幂次法则？对于创业者来说，幂次法则提供了哪些启示？**
1.  But no matter how unambiguous the end result of the power law, it doesn't reflect daily experience.
2.  And since nobody wants to give up on an investment, VCs usually spend even more time on the most problematic companies than they do on the most obviously successful.
3.  As we said, even the best venture investors have a portfolio, but investors who understand the power law make as few investments as possible.
4.  The power law means that differences between companies will dwarf the differences in roles inside companies.

## 2018.12.24
**什么是商业世界反主流的问题（在哪些重要问题上你与其他人有不同的看法）？
为什么大部分人已经不相信世界还有未被探索的秘密存在？**

1.  Contrarian thinking doesn't make any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up.
2.  Every correct answer is necessarily a secret: something important and unknown, something hard to do but doable. If there are many secrets left in the world, there are probably many world-­changing companies yet to be started.
3.  Why has so much of our society come to believe that there are no hard secrets left? It might start with geography. There are no blank spaces left on the map anymore.

## 2018.12.25
**哪些社会趋势让人们不再相信世界上存在着未知和秘密？
世界假如没有任何秘密，将会是什么样的？**

1.  People are scared of secrets because they are scared of being wrong. By definition, a secret hasn't been vetted by the mainstream. If your goal is to never make a mistake in your life, you shouldn't look for secrets.
2.  Social elites have the most freedom and ability to explore new thinking, but they seem to believe in secrets the least. Why search for a new secret if you can comfortably collect rents on everything that has already been done?

## 2018.12.26
**我们应该如何发现与寻找秘密？哪些领域可以挖掘出有价值的秘密——从而创造改变世界的企业？
我们是否应该讲秘密分享给别人呢？**
1.  Great companies can be built on open but unsuspected secrets about how the world works.
2.  So when thinking about what kind of company to build, there are two distinct questions to ask: What secrets is nature not telling you? What secrets are people not telling you?
3.  The best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking.
4.  The best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is built around a secret that's hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator.

## 2018.12.27
**什么是建立一个初创公司的基础？
初创公司内部不团结的最主要原因是什么？
初创公司的内部权力主要有哪些？**
1.  Bad decisions made early on—­if you choose the wrong partners or hire the wrong people, for example—­are very hard to correct after they are made.
2.  Choosing a co­founder is like getting married, and founder conflict is just as ugly as divorce. Optimism abounds at the start of every relationship. It's unromantic to think soberly about what could go wrong, so people don't.
3.  You need good people who get along, but you also need a structure to help keep everyone aligned for the long term.

## 2018.12.28
**初创公司应慎重地选择董事会成员，雇佣全职员工，且不以现金报酬作为激励员工的主要手段。**
1.  The potential for conflict increases over time as interests diverge: a board member might want to take a company public as soon as possible to score a win for his venture firm, while the founders would prefer to stay private and grow the business.
2.  If you're deciding whether to bring someone on board, the decision is binary. Ken Kesey was right: you're either on the bus or off the bus.
3.  But even so-called incentive pay encourages short-term thinking and value grabbing. Any kind of cash is more about the present than the future.

## 2018.12.29
**如果现金报酬并非激励员工的最佳选择，那么我们应该如何引导员工创造价值呢？
理想的创业公司文化应该有着何种内涵？如何打造公司的帮派文化？**
1.  Anyone who prefers owning a part of your company to being paid in cash reveals a preference for the long term and a commitment to increasing your company’s value in the future.
2.  Every company is a culture. A startup is a team of people on a mission, and a good culture is just what that looks like on the inside.
3.  Since time is your most valuable asset, it's odd to spend it working with people who don't envision any long-term future together.

## 2018.12.30
**初创公司应努力寻找认同公司使命，可以和睦共事，甚至有着相同气质和爱好的员工，并让每个员工只负责一件事情。**
1.  Just cover the basics like health insurance and then promise what no others can: the opportunity to do irreplaceable work on a unique problem alongside great people.
2.  The startup uniform encapsulates a simple but essential principle: everyone at your 
3.  company should be different in the same way—a tribe of like-minded people fiercely devoted to the company’s mission.
3.  The best thing I did as a manager at PayPal was to make every person in the company responsible for doing just one thing. Every employee’s one thing was unique, and everyone knew I would evaluate him only on that one thing.

## 2018.12.31
**优秀的初创公司和邪教有什么共同点？又有什么不同？
销售对于硅谷公司有什么意义？为何硅谷的技术精英往往低估了销售？**

**由于最有效的销售往往是隐形的，因而很多人，特别是硅谷技术精英，难以察觉销售对企业极其重要的作用。**

1.  But advertising doesn't exist to make you buy a product right away; it exists to embed subtle impressions that will drive sales later. Anyone who can't acknowledge its likely effect on himself is doubly deceived.
2.  All salesmen are actors: their priority is persuasion, not sincerity.
3.  Like acting, sales works best when hidden.

## 2019.1.1
**如何判断推广策略是否有效？
复杂销售与人员销售各有什么特点？它们的销售策略和增长模式有何不同？**

**销售与推销对于垄断的形成至关重要，而产品的销售预算和方案应与产品的售价与定位有关。**

1.  If you've invented something new but you haven't invented an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business—­no matter how good the product.
2.  In general, the higher the price of your product, the more you have to spend to make a sale—­and the more it makes sense to spend it.
3.  Good enterprise sales strategy starts small, as it must: a new customer might agree to become your biggest customer, but they'll rarely be comfortable signing a deal completely out of scale with what you've sold before.

## 2019.1.2
**小企业销售的盲区和瓶颈包括哪些？
初创公司应该如何投放广告？投放广告时应该避免哪些误区？
什么是病毒式营销？病毒式营销如何帮助初创公司快速成长？**

**销售与推销对于垄断的形成至关重要，而产品的销售预算和方案应与产品的售价与定位有关。**

1.  Every entrepreneur envies a recognizable ad campaign, but startups should resist the temptation to compete with bigger companies in the endless contest to put on the most memorable TV spots or the most elaborate PR stunts.
2.  A product is viral if its core functionality encourages users to invite their friends to become users too.
3.  Whoever is first to dominate the most important segment of a market with viral potential will be the last mover in the whole market.

## 2019.1.3
**产品的销售是如何遵守幂次法则的？
如何将产品推销给员工、投资者和媒体？
为什么现代技术的发展让不少人恐惧？技术会代替人类吗？**

**初创企业应在各个环节融入销售的智慧，并找到最适合自己的销售手段。
计算机技术的不断发展也带来了人类即将被机器取代的恐慌，虽然比起机器，人们更有可能被来自其他国家的竞争者所取代。**

1.  Most businesses get zero distribution channels to work: poor sales rather than bad product is the most common cause of failure.
2.  Everybody has a product to sell—no matter whether you're an employee, a founder, or an investor. It's true even if your company consists of just you and your computer.
3.  Americans fear technology in the near future because they see it as a replay of the globalization of the near past. But the situations are very different: people compete for jobs and for resources; computers compete for neither.

## 2019.1.4
**全球化和科技，哪个才会造成人们恐惧的竞争与失业？
人类和计算机为何不是相互取代的关系，而是互补的关系？**

**全球化意味着竞争和替代，而科技意味着补充。而人类与计算机的互补是创立未来伟大事业的途径。**


1.  The stark differences between man and machine mean that gains from working with computers are much higher than gains from trade with other people.
2.  Properly understood, technology is the one way for us to escape competition in a globalizing world. As computers become more and more powerful, they won't be substitutes for humans: they'll be complements.
3.  Complementarity between computers and humans isn't just a macro-scale fact. It's also the path to building a great business.

## 2019.1.5
**为什么那么多人误以为计算机能够代替人类，而忽视了人机互补的必要性？
计算机是否可能替代人类？**

**“机器学习”和“大数据”等流行概念让人们忽视了人力在技术发展过程中的辅助作用，人类一时半会儿不会被计算机取代，因此这种恐慌不应该阻止我们制定计划、发展技术。**

1.  The very term “machine learning” evokes imagery of replacement, and its boosters seem to believe that computers can be taught to perform almost any task, so long as we feed them enough training data.
2.  We have let ourselves become enchanted by big data only because we exoticize technology. We're impressed with small feats accomplished by computers alone, but we ignore big achievements from complementarity because the human contribution makes them less uncanny.
3.  Replacement by computers is a worry for the 22nd century. Indefinite fears about the far future shouldn't stop us from making definite plans today.

## 2019.1.6
**为什么清洁能源公司的泡沫在2010年后迅速破灭？清洁技术缘何惨遭失败？**

**清洁能源被视为21世纪的朝阳产业，然而近些年来对清洁能源产业的投资徒劳无功，多数清洁能源公司由于未能解决好创业企业面临的七个问题而失败。**

1.  It didn't work. Instead of a healthier planet, we got a massive cleantech bubble.
2.  Companies must strive for 10x better because merely incremental improvements often end up meaning no improvement at all for the end user.
3.  Cleantech entrepreneurs' thinking about markets was hopelessly confused. They would rhetorically shrink their market in order to seem differentiated, only to turn around and ask to be valued based on huge, supposedly lucrative markets.

## 2019.1.7
**清洁能源公司还面临着什么样的人员、销售问题？
清洁能源公司为何无法持久发展？如何才能成为特定市场的坚守者，而不被竞争者所超越？**

**倒闭的清洁能源公司还面临着严重的人员和销售问题，不仅如此，清洁能源公司也未能做好长远规划，以应对外界的竞争。**

1.  The most obvious clue was sartorial: cleantech executives were running around wearing suits and ties. This was a huge red flag, because real technologists wear T-shirts and jeans. 
2.  They learned the hard way that the world is not a laboratory: selling and delivering a product is at least as important as the product itself.
3.  But was competition from Chinese manufacturers really impossible to predict? Cleantech entrepreneurs would have done well to rephrase the durability question and ask: what will stop China from wiping out my business? Without an answer, the result shouldn't have come as a surprise.

## 2019.1.8
**为什么清洁能源公司的公益理念反而导致了它的失败？
特斯拉是如何从清洁技术公司中脱颖而出的？它是如何解决清洁技术公司普遍面临的七个问题的？**

清洁能源公司使用普遍认可的观念发展企业，没有去发现秘密，因而在竞争中失败。而特斯拉则解决了清洁能源公司所普遍面临的7个问题，因而取得了成功。

1.  Every cleantech company justified itself with conventional truths about the need for a cleaner world. They deluded themselves into believing that an overwhelming social need for alternative energy solutions implied an overwhelming business opportunity for cleantech companies of all kinds.
2.  Social entrepreneurs aim to combine the best of both worlds and “do well by doing good.” Usually they end up doing neither.
3.  Doing something different is what's truly good for society—­and it's also what allows a business to profit by monopolizing a new market.

## 2019.1.9
**特斯拉发现了清洁技术领域的何种秘密？
特斯拉的成功和其他清洁技术公司的失败给了我们何种启示？未来的清洁能源公司应该如何开始自己的发展？**

**特斯拉的成功启示我们，即使是站在风口的创业公司，也只能通过找准小市场、发现秘密，并拿出最佳解决方案，才能在激烈的市场竞争中生存。**

1.  While generic cleantech companies struggled to differentiate themselves, Tesla built a unique brand around the secret that cleantech was even more of a social phenomenon than an environmental imperative.

2.  The macro need for energy solutions is still real. But a valuable business must start by finding a niche and dominating a small market.

**特斯拉的市场定位和销售策略**

特斯拉一开始的市场定位就非常独特且精准，就是“高端时尚的纯电动轿跑车”，这个定位创造了一个全新的市场空间，也就是作者所说的在“小的利基市场内实现垄断”。

从十九世纪以来，大部分车企推出的主打车型往往都是家用轿车这一受众广泛、技术门槛相对不高、价格也不高的车型，比如我们熟知的福特 T 型车等等。

而这些年来传统车企开发的新能源车型，也以中档乘用车为主，因为续航能力等原因，绝大部分车型都是小型车，比如日产聆风、宝马i3以及比亚迪 F3DM 等等。而特斯拉就成为了唯一一个以高端电动跑车为主打车型的新能源车企。

特斯拉高端时尚且节能的车型定位，可以让它把客户聚焦在高薪人群。这些人群往往接受新事物的能力强，有着较好的环保意识和更强的炫耀欲望，特斯拉完美切合了他们的需求，并颠覆了新的市场。而且从小型的利基市场起家，也有助于特斯拉进行必要的研发，制造价格稍低的Ｓ型汽车。

特斯拉拥有独特的颠覆式的销售模式，例如采取独特的销售渠道：包括体验店和先预定再制造的完整销售链模式。

和传统的通过4S经销商店的营销渠道完全不同，特斯拉通过将装修炫目而时尚的体验专卖店开在大型高端商场的底层，直接进行汽车展示和订购，大大减少了因为经销商的存在而导致汽车价格浮动。

而且体验店里面的销售人员不会像 4S 店里的销售人员不断推销产品，而是像苹果体验店一样让客户更好的体验产品，也有利于维护特斯拉的高端时尚的产品形象。

此外，特斯拉的广告模式也别出心裁。特斯拉采取完全不同于传统广告的“拉动广告”策略，包括使用社交媒体、让人们对这一品牌进行口口相传。例如通过请大量的名人、政客、影星等KOL（Key Opinion Leader，关键意见领袖）作为自己的第一批客户，并通过他们在社交媒体上引发讨论。在销售完成后，他们不仅引导用户在社交媒体上分享驾车体验，同时也把创始人Elon Musk包装成“硅谷钢铁侠”，通过Elon Musk本身在各种镜头前去讲故事并推动口碑。这些价值传播方式是以往任何一个车企都未做过的。

## 2019.1.10
**为什么成功的创业者往往给人以特立独行的印象？
创业者的极端形象是天生的？还是被社会和媒体追捧、夸大而成的？**

**神话中的国王、当代名人、公司的创始人往往都表现出矛盾而极端的人格特征。他们的独特个性往往经过人群和媒体的传播，而变得更为极端。**

1.  Startup CEOs can be cash poor but millionaires on paper. They may oscillate between sullen jerkiness and appealing charisma. Almost all successful entrepreneurs are simultaneously insiders and outsiders. And when they do succeed, they attract both fame and infamy.
2.  The most famous people in the world are founders, too: instead of a company, every celebrity founds and cultivates a personal brand.
3.  The famous and infamous have always served as vessels for public sentiment: they're praised amid prosperity and blamed for misfortune.

## 2019.1.11
**为何大众总是津津乐道于名人巨星的陨落？只有早逝的明星才能“封神”？
著名的创始人为何总是被人攻击，最终不得不离开自己所创造的企业？**

**就如同大众总是喜欢崇拜或贬低名人，他们也十分热衷于神化或攻击企业的创始人，比尔·盖茨和乔布斯都曾因为这种攻击而被逐出企业。**

1.  Perhaps the only way to be a rock god forever is to die an early death.
2.  Apple's value crucially depended on the singular vision of a particular person. This hints at the strange way in which the companies that create new technology often resemble feudal monarchies rather than organizations that are supposedly more “modern.”
3.  A unique founder can make authoritative decisions, inspire strong personal loyalty, and plan ahead for decades. Paradoxically, impersonal bureaucracies staffed by trained professionals can last longer than any lifetime, but they usually act with short time horizons.

## 2019.1.12
**公司应该从比尔·盖茨和乔布斯的案例中吸取哪些教训？
人类的未来会遵循何种历史发展模式？新技术在历史发展中将承担何种角色？**

**只有创造新技术，才能消解竞争的压力，走向更加美好的未来。而技术创新的前提则是独立思考，重新认识世界。**

1.  The single greatest danger for a founder is to become so certain of his own myth that he loses his mind. But an equally insidious danger for every business is to lose all sense of myth and mistake disenchantment for wisdom.
2.  The most dramatic version of this outcome is called the Singularity, an attempt to name the imagined result of new technologies so powerful as to transcend the current limits of our understanding.
3.  Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better—to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future.
