2. The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

1. The entrepreneurs who stuck with Silicon Valley learned four big lesson from the dot-com crash that still guide business thinking today:

- Make incremental advances.
- Stayl lean and flexible.
- Improve on the competition.
- Focus on product,not sales.

**什么公司才是既前无古人又具有高价值的呢？**
**竞争和垄断，哪一个才能让公司真正立于不败之地？**
